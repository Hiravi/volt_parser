First, I wanted to touch on a few things before we go deeper into the Phoenix Tailings discussion. We've got some interesting developments in the sector. So, MP Materials has finally completed its acquisition of Lynas Rare Earths' processing facility in Texas. Big news. I've been talking to Eric Zhang, their CEO, and it seems like they're gearing up to ramp up production, focusing primarily on neodymium and praseodymium. The demand for these metals is still through the roof.
But that's something we need to keep in mind as we look at Phoenix Tailings. They're in the same space, though their approach is a bit different. We all know about their focus on recycling mining tailings. I'm particularly curious about how Phoenix plans to compete with these traditional players like MP Materials and Lynas,  MP Materials especially with their environmentally  MP Materials friendly claims.
